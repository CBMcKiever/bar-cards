# Ingredient Feature:

### Description:
This feature is designed to enable users to browse ingredients they might either have on hand, or be interested in making a drink with. The ingredients are presented as a grid of cards, where each card contains simply a name, picture, and a button which links to the drinks feature to show all drinks that can be made with a given ingredient. There are 25 ingredients per page.
